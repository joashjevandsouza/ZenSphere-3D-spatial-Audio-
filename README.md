# ZenSphere-3D-spatial-Audio-
Interactive Web Audio application featuring an HRTF 3D spatial engine, custom Lofi processing chain (BitCrusher/Vibrato), and dynamic 'Aura' UI. Built with React, Tone.js, and Tailwind CSS.

For Audio, download any mp3 or audio file on your device and upload it to test the application 

ZenSphere is a high-fidelity, interactive web application designed to create immersive 3D spatial soundscapes with a signature "lofi" aesthetic. Built using React and the Tone.js audio framework, it allows users to intuitively arrange and manipulate audio sources in a virtual three-dimensional environment.1. Core Concept: The Spatial Sound StageThe heart of the application is a circular "Sound Stage" that acts as a 2D interface for a 3D audio world.The Listener: Represented by a central fixed avatar $(0, 0, 0)$. All audio is panned relative to this point.Interactive Nodes: Users drag icons representing different sounds (instruments, nature, ambient effects) around the stage.3D Panning (HRTF): Unlike standard stereo panning, ZenSphere uses Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) math to simulate how sound hits the human ear from specific angles and distances, creating a true sense of "behind," "above," or "next to".2. The Professional Lofi EngineThe application features a dedicated "Lofi Mode" that processes the master audio through a sequential digital signal processing (DSP) chain to emulate vintage analog warmth.Muffled Filtering: A steep Low-Pass Filter (cut at $\approx2200Hz$) removes modern digital "crispness" to create a distant, underwater feel.Digital Degradation: A BitCrusher reduces the audio to $10$ or $12$ bits, introducing the grit and "crunch" characteristic of 1990s hardware samplers.Tape Wow (Vibrato): A slow, subtle Vibrato ($0.4Hz$) modulates the pitch to simulate the physical instability of a spinning cassette tape or vinyl record.Saturation: Adds harmonic distortion to provide "weight" and warmth to the overall mix.3. Technical Features & PerformanceClipping Protection: A Tone.Limiter is active on the master bus to prevent digital "crackling" and distortion when multiple loud sounds overlap.Dynamic Ramping: To prevent "pops" and "clicks" during movement, all volume and position changes are smoothly interpolated (ramped) over $100ms$.Resource Management: The app utilizes Audio Buffer decoding and strictly manages node disposal to ensure the browser's CPU doesn't overload during long sessions.4. Atmospheric User InterfaceAura Background: A dynamic background that smoothly cycles through a palette of deep blues and purples, synced to the "chill" mood of the application.Lucide Iconography: A clean set of icons for music production (Piano, Guitar, Drum) and environmental sounds (Waves, Fire).Glassmorphic Design: A modern UI style using semi-transparent layers and blur effects to maintain focus on the spatial stage.
